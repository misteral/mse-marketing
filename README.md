# iOS mobile application Male Sexual Energy

## Definitions

**Male Swxual Energy** - It is a type of energy that allows a man to remain an active sexual partner and to exhibit sexual desire.

## Why, how, What

***Why?*** I believe that a man can be unafraid of engaging in sexual intercourse with a partner. I believe that a man can feel internally strong and self-assured.

***How?*** Male ejaculate is a source of vitality. If a man nurtures his reserves and utilises them judiciously, his life becomes imbued with confidence. The production of semen requires the expenditure of energy, nutrients, and time. Let us regulate this vital resource. A man can partake in sexual activity and achieve orgasm without depleting his semen, each time!

***What?*** I have developed an application that calculates the current level of male sexual energy based on age. It enables you to determine the optimal time for the next release of semen without compromising health. The application offers recommendations based on the individual's current energy level.

### Description

Track your sexual activity, monitor your sexual energy levels and receive customized recommendations based on your age.
Please note that this app is designed exclusively for male users.

This application offers a variety of features, including the ability to record and track your sexual activity by integrating with the "Health" app. You can also view a visual representation of your sexual energy levels over the past month and receive personalized recommendations based on your age and sexual activity.

According to ancient Chinese Taoist teachings, a man's ability to engage in sexual activity is limited by his available energy. Sperm is considered to be the storehouse of male sexual energy, and its production can consume up to one third of a man's daily energy output, putting a strain on his glandular and immune systems. The preservation of sexual energy is therefore key to improving sexual health.

This app is designed to help you track your current level of male sexual energy based on your age and sexual activity. Your sexual energy is restored every day through the vitality of your body, but the rate of restoration varies depending on your age. Older men may experience a slower restoration rate compared to younger men. If your energy level is below 100%, it is recommended that you engage in sexual activity without ejaculation to preserve your body's valuable resources.

After each activity, the app provides recommendations on how to preserve your energy for a full and active life. However, please note that this app is not a medical product and should not replace professional medical advice.

To make this app accessible and understandable to all users, please contact us directly at support@itbeaver.co if you encounter any difficulties using our application. Please provide a detailed description of the problem in your message. Thank you.
