Looking for feedback and beta testers - Male Sexual Energy

[Check it out here](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1198577386?pt=118187505&ct=alphaandbetausers&mt=8)

**Greetings all!**

**Why?** I believe that a man can be unafraid of engaging in sexual intercourse with a partner. I believe that a man can feel internally strong and self-assured.

**How?** Male ejaculate is a source of vitality. If a man nurtures his reserves and utilises them judiciously, his life becomes imbued with confidence. The production of semen requires the expenditure of energy, nutrients, and time. Let us regulate this vital resource. A man can partake in sexual activity and achieve orgasm without depleting his semen, each time!

**What?** I have developed an application that calculates the current level of male sexual energy based on age. It enables you to determine the optimal time for the next release of semen without compromising health. The application offers recommendations based on the individual's current energy level. 

I am would greatly appreciate your feedback! Your input is valuable to me as I continue to improve and enhance the app. 

Please take a few moments to provide your thoughts and opinions on the following aspects of the application:


1. User Interface: How intuitive and user-friendly do you find the app's interface? Is it easy to navigate through the various features and sections?

2. Feature Set: Are the features offered by the app useful and relevant to your needs? Do you find the integration with the "Health" app beneficial in tracking and recording your sexual activity?

3. Visual Representation: How helpful is the visual representation of your sexual energy levels over the past month? Does it provide you with a clear understanding of your energy patterns?

4. Personalized Recommendations: Have you found the personalized recommendations based on your age and sexual activity helpful in improving your sexual health? Do you feel that they are tailored to your specific needs?

5. Accuracy and Reliability: How accurate and reliable do you find the app in tracking and measuring your sexual energy levels? Have you noticed any discrepancies or inconsistencies?

6. Additional Feedback: Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with our app? Any suggestions or improvements you would like to see implemented?

Please keep in mind that while the app is designed to assist you in tracking and preserving your sexual energy, it is not a medical product and should not replace professional medical advice. If you have any concerns or questions regarding your sexual health, we strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional.

Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. Your input is greatly appreciated and will help me in ongoing efforts to improve my mobile application.

Hey r/Entrepreneur!

I resigned from my day job approximately 8 months ago to develop an iOS application that assists men in controlling their ejaculations and calculating Male Sexual Energy based on age and sexual activity. However, I am currently unsure about how to effectively promote my application and attract users. I would greatly appreciate any advice you could provide. Additionally, I welcome any feedback and would like to invite you to participate in beta testing. You can check out the application [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1198577386?pt=118187505&ct=alphaandbetausers&mt=8), and for beta testing, please direct message me.
